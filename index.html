      <h2> Introduction</h2>
      <p id="p1"> The Philippines has been impacted by climate change in a variety of ways, and these effects can be
        observed as the phenomenon continues to accelerate. The measured temperature in the Philippines has risen by
        0.68 degrees Celsius over the course of the past 65 years, from 1951 to 2015; this represents an increase of 0.1
        degrees Celsius every decade on average. By the middle of the 21st century, it is anticipated that the average
        temperature in the Philippines may have increased by anywhere from 0.9 degrees Celsius to 1.9 degrees Celsius
        (according to RCP 4.5) or by 1.2 degrees Celsius to 2.3 degrees Celsius (according to RCP8.5). The population,
        particularly those who live in places with poor ventilation or in metropolitan areas, are feeling the effects of
        this rising warmth.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p id="p1">
        Extreme heat can put people at risk for a variety of ailments, including heatstroke, heat exhaustion,
        hyperthermia, and others. If there is technology that can bring the temperature down in the room, then these
        difficulties can be avoided. There are a variety of home appliances that can be used to cool down a room, such
        as electric fans, air conditioners, air coolers, and so on; however, most of these solutions require the use of
        electricity, which frequently requires the burning of fossil fuels and thus contributes to global warming.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p id="p1">
        Researchers have developed the concept of an air conditioner that makes use of Peltier cells as the cooler as a
        solution to the issues that have been raised. The use of an electrical current in a device known as a Peltier
        cell results in the production of a cold temperature. The researcher is going to combine a solar power system
        with a cooling system that makes use of Peltier cells so that they may construct an air conditioning system that
        is driven by solar energy.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p id="p1">
        This device will get its electricity from the sun in order to function properly. The resources of this device
        will be managed by a microcontroller, which will be utilized by this device. The purpose of the system is to
        bring the temperature of a confined space down to a more tolerable level in order to create a more comfortable
        environment in areas that have a high temperature and no ventilation.

      <h2> Statement of the Problem</h2>
      <p id="p1">Since the pre-industrial period, humans observed long-term heating in the surface of the earth. this
        phenomenon is called global warming. Due to global warming, we experience hotter temperature than the last
        decade. based on an article entitled PH Reaches Highest Heat Index So Far This Year at 53 Degrees Celsius
        (Coconuts Manila, 2022) that this year the hottest recorded temperature are 53 degrees Celsius in Dagupan,
        Pangasinan. These increasing temperatures are detrimental to people with old age and people that lives in urban
        areas or houses without proper ventilation. This research aims to answer the following questions: </p>

          <li>How to design an air conditioning system that will use Peltier cell?</li>
          <li>How to integrate solar panel to power the device?</li>
          <li>How to develop a software that will control the functions of the air conditioning?</li>
          <li>How will the researchers test the capabilities of the device?</li>
          <li> How will the researchers evaluate the effectiveness of solar powered air conditioning?</li>
